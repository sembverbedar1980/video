## Benefits of Cartridge Replacement

Replacing a faucet cartridge offers several advantages:

- **Eliminates Leaks**: A worn-out cartridge is often the culprit behind persistent drips. Replacing it stops leaks and saves water.
- **Restores Water Pressure**: Over time, mineral buildup can clog the cartridge, reducing water flow. A new cartridge ensures consistent pressure.
- **Improves Handle Operation**: If your faucet handle is stiff or hard to turn, a new cartridge can restore smooth operation.
- **Cost-Effective**: Cartridge replacement is far more affordable than installing a brand-new faucet.
- **Extends Faucet Life**: Regular maintenance, including cartridge replacement, can prolong the life of your faucet.
