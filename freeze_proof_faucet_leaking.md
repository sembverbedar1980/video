## Why Freeze-Proof Faucets Leak  

Freeze-proof faucets are designed to prevent water from freezing inside the pipe by shutting off the water supply further back in the warm interior. However, leaks can occur due to:  

- **Worn-out washers or seals:** Over time, the internal components degrade.  
- **Improper installation:** If the faucet isnâ€™t installed correctly, it can lead to leaks.  
- **Cracked pipes:** Extreme temperature changes can cause the pipe to crack.  
- **Debris buildup:** Sediment or debris can clog the valve, preventing it from closing fully.

Repairing a leaking freeze-proof faucet offers several advantages:  

- **Prevents water waste:** A leaky faucet can waste hundreds of gallons of water annually.  
- **Protects your property:** Leaks can lead to water damage, mold, and increased utility bills.  
- **Extends faucet lifespan:** Timely repairs can prevent the need for a full replacement.
