## Why Replace a Single Handle Bathtub Faucet Cartridge?  

The cartridge is the heart of your faucet, controlling water flow and temperature. Over time, it can wear out due to mineral buildup, corrosion, or general use. Here are the key benefits of replacing it:  

- **Eliminates Leaks:** A worn-out cartridge often causes dripping, which wastes water and increases your utility bills.  
- **Restores Functionality:** A new cartridge ensures smooth operation of the handle and consistent water flow.  
- **Improves Water Temperature Control:** If your water suddenly turns hot or cold, a faulty cartridge is likely the culprit.  
- **Extends Faucet Lifespan:** Regular maintenance prevents more expensive repairs or full faucet replacement.
